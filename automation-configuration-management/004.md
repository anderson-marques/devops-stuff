# How to install Ansible

## Use apt (or other package manager)

```bash
host@user:~$ sudo apt install ansible
```

## Generate key pair

```bash
host@user:~$ ssh-keygen
```

- private key: `/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa` (for Ansible machine)
- public key: `/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (to copy to `.ssh/authorized_keys` on hosts)

## ssh-agent

`ssh-agent` sends our id_rsa key automatically, so we don't have to put it as an argument

```bash
host@user:~$ ssh-agent bash
host@user:~$ ssh-add .ssh/id_rsa
```
