# Ansible Best Practices

- Use roles! Always use roles
- Use version control (git)
- Dynamic inventory with clouds
- Tag instances with dev / staging / prod, have separate inventory files
  - You can assign variables to groups to organize them
  - A host can be in multiple groups (e.g. geography + function)
- Use rolling updates (start updating a percentage of your prod servers)
- Use group_by to deal with different operating systems

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  task:
    - group_by: key=os_{{ansible_distribution}}
```

- Or split the variables per OS

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  task:
    - include_vars: "os_{{ansible_distribution}}.yml"
```

- Use whitespaces and comments (#)
- Always name tasks (using `-name`)
- Keep it simple!
